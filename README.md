# asemicroutes

This counter-navigational tool is designed to help users traverse New York City (and the surrounding area) in a more psychogeographic way.<br>

Asemic writing usually refers to a wordless, open semantic form of literature. The open nature of asemic work allows for meaning to emerge across linguistic understanding; multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic content can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. So, what happens when you apply this concept to urban navigation?<br>

The program spits out a random address (a suggested destination) and an “asemic route” (a string of ten alphanumeric characters). Users are tasked with interpreting the string as a pathway through the city. I have been tracing the characters out around the city as if I am drawing crop circles with my feet; I become a kind of geo-pencil. The alphanumeric character-routes generated by the program are not meant to tell users where to go, but rather, empower users to create their own pathways. This logic is starkly divergent from conventional navigation systems like street signs, GPS, and even commercial traffic flow that reinforce a rationalized, limited sensorium of the city. Within an asemic navigational framework, which seeks to increase play and destabilize preconceived views of the city, there is not one correct answer, but rather, a multiplicity of correct answers.<br>

"an ensemble of signs capable of transmitting the reality served by the consciousness more exactly than all the former fragmentary and partial practices (phonetic alphabets, algebra, geometry, painting, music, and so forth)."<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphy<br>

"The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be 'read' in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time."<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing<br>

"There is no combination of characters one can make—dhcmrlchtdj, for example—that the divine Library has not foreseen and that in one or more of its secret tongues does not hide a terrible significance. There is no syllable one can speak that is not filled with tenderness and terror, that is not, in one of those languages, the mighty name of a god."<br>
