# LOBroutes.py

Jorge Luis Borges’ short story <i>The Library of Babel</i> is about a vast and virtually infinite library. The pages of the books in the library contain every possible permutation of 25 basic characters (twenty-two lowercase letters, the comma, the full-stop, and the space); the majority of the books are pure gibberish and no two books are exactly the same. Borges’ narrator and other wanderers explore the vast universe of books in an effort to find a book that explains the enigmatic library. As a researcher interested in psychogeography and different forms of wandering, Borges’ story inspired me to apply this idea of searching for meaning in textual nonsense in another context: urban navigation.<br>

In 2024, I developed a Python program called <i>LOBRoutes.py</i>. The program generates a “route”—a random string of 410 alphanumeric characters. Users are tasked with interpreting the string, or parts of the string, as a navigational pathway through physical space. My favorite way to use the program is to create geo-drawings. I trace the characters out as if I am creating giant crop circles with my feet. However, users can create their own interpretations and rule structures. Afterall, the alphanumeric character-routes generated by the program are not meant to tell users where to go, but rather, prompt users to playfully (and perhaps inefficiently) move through spaces. The logic of the program is intentionally divergent from conventional navigation tools like street signs, GPS, and even commercial traffic flow, which all to a varying degree reinforce a limited urban sensorium. <i>LOBRoutes.py</i> is a simple tool for those interested in phygital psychogeographic experiences. 

<b>Notes/Links:</b>

“There is no combination of characters one can make—dhcmrlchtdj, for example—that the divine Library has not foreseen and that in one or more of its secret tongues does not hide a terrible significance. There is no syllable one can speak that is not filled with tenderness and terror, that is not, in one of those languages, the mighty name of a god.”<br>
