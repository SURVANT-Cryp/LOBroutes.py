# asemicroutes

This counter-navigational tool is designed to help users traverse New York City (and the surrounding area) in a more psychogeographic way. The program spits out a random address (a suggested starting point for an excursion) and an “asemic route”—a string of ten alphanumeric characters. The user is tasked with interpreting the string any way they choose. I have been tracing the characters out around the city as if I am drawing crop circles with my feet. Asemic writing usually refers to a wordless, open semantic form of literature; allow me to explain why I refer to the random routes generated by the program as being asemic. The open nature of asemic work allows for meaning to emerge across linguistic understanding; Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic content can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. So, what happens when you apply this concept to urban navigation? The alphanumeric character-routes generated by the program are not meant to tell users where to go, but rather, empower users to create their own pathways. This logic is starkly divergent from conventional navigation systems like street signs, GPS, and even commercial traffic flow that all reinforce a rationalized, limited sensorium of the city. Within an asemic navigational framework, which seeks to increase play and destabilize preconceived views of the city, there is not one correct answer, but rather, a multiplicity of correct answers.<br>

"an ensemble of signs capable of transmitting the reality served by the consciousness more exactly than all the former fragmentary and partial practices (phonetic alphabets, algebra, geometry, painting, music, and so forth)."<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphy<br>

"The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be 'read' in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time."<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asemic_writing<br>
